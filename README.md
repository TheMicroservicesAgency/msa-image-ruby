## Nginx configuration

Nginx is preconfigured to listen on the port **80**, and act as a reverse proxy to any HTTP application running on the port **8080**.

Nginx will foward every HTTP request to the port 8080, except for the following URLs, since they are reserved by convention.

Any microservice built with this image should overrite the following files via the COPY command in the Dockerfile, to update these endpoints.

| File                          | URL                           |
